# Raydiance
A CPU-based ray tracing engine built from scratch in C++, capable of rendering realistic 3D scenes using fundamental graphics algorithms. The project focuses on implementing the core physics of light, mathematical modeling of scenes, and efficient rendering techniques without external graphics libraries.
